CHEM 313 Final Project proposal

    Recently [1], a neural network-based approach for approximating reaction committors has been used to obtain accurate transition rates in molecular systems. It combines a novel sampling method with a logarithmic committor loss function, but it uses a simple feed-forward neural network and highly naive all-pairs distance function for its molecular configuration model. The authors acknowledge the ability to improve with more suitable data structures and algorithms in these areas, but leave it to a further work.
    I would like to improve on these methods with GCNs/GNNs/CNNs to see how significant these speed or accuracy improvements can be. They also discuss the challenge of handling metastable transition states with their sampling technique, so I would like to explore some of the Markov state models [2] they allude to as possible algorithmic fixes.
    There is some code available from the original paper as a starting point, and the simpler toy models appear to be tractable on my personal laptop.
