CHEM 313 Final Project proposal

    Recently [1], a neural network-based approach for approximating reaction committors has been used to obtain accurate transition rates in molecular systems. It combines a novel sampling method with a logarithmic committor loss function, but it uses a simple feed-forward neural network and highly naive all-pairs distance function for its molecular configuration model. The authors acknowledge the ability to improve with more suitable data structures and algorithms in these areas, but leave it to a further work.
    I would like to improve on these methods with GCNs/GNNs/CNNs to see how significant these speed or accuracy improvements can be. They also discuss the challenge of handling metastable transition states with their sampling technique, so I would like to explore some of the Markov state models [2] they allude to as possible algorithmic fixes.
    There is some code available from the original paper as a starting point, and the simpler toy models appear to be tractable on my personal laptop.

Notes

2d MB potential
flux_sample:
    computes N_exit positions and times for a particle starting in center of basin to hit the *boundary* of *its own* basin
    this estimates the exist fluxes and gives a distribution j_A_-for *where* it exits
    1000 each
take_reporter_steps
    take a point on a boundary of a basin
    off of an initial point, n_traj=5 trajectories are shot off
calculate_committor_estimates
    uses the net to predict on a trajectory sample

MB.py
    generates the flux sample
    for N steps:
        take the highest committor point since last step (X_xs or boundary point of X basin)
        take_reporter_steps from X_xs
        take the reporter swarm, feed to committor predictor
            snap anything in basins to 0,1, calculate mean estimates of swarm committors
        concatenate to X_running_short_reporters (full history of swarm)
        gradient NN on the self-consistence expectation of log committor thing on all data up to point (even swarm stopping points)

        calcualte transition probability: j_A_- \int q(x) dx (on boundary) where the j_A_- is estimate from the initial flux (this is the "Hill Relation")


TODO:
    1. get the committor estimates running for the MD simulations of AIB9
    2. investigate the metastability problem in Aib9
    3. make theoretical fix
    4. implement it
    5. presentation
